<h3>Furigana Injector has been shutdown (as of Dec 31 2013)</h3>
Feel free to fork any code here if you'd like to make a replacement.

N.b. the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/furigana-inserter/">Furigana Inserter</a> fork is still alive and well.

udonmai-san has built the furigana*server on MacOSX, so that he can run it all locally on his desktop/laptop.

His github of his own version is at https://github.com/udonmai/furigana-injector/. The instructions of his changes are on the following wiki page: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/furigana-injector/wiki/Udonmai_MacOSX_build">Udonmai_MacOSX_build</a>.

<h3>Furigana Injector was ...</h3>

a Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome extension that inserts furigana for kanji words.

It was the sum of these parts:
* <a href="http://mecab.sourceforge.net/">MeCab</a> natural-language parser (server or XPCOM component.)
* Adjustable array of user's known kanji (javascript)
* Webpage-text parsing (javascript)
* Webpage DOM manipulation to insert <RUBY> tags. (javascript)
* GUI controls and help pages (javascript, image and html resources)

If you want to contact the developer you may freely email him at <b>akira.kurogane</b> at gmail. If you want to use the server program as a localhost service you will have to compile for yourself, so <b>experienced C++ project builders only</b> thanks.
