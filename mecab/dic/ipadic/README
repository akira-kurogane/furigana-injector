This directory should contain these files:

char.bin
dicrc
matrix.bin
sys.dic
unk.dic

The *.dic and *.bin files are being omitted from source control due to their size. They should be same as ones generated by the official Mecab package, when using the "ipadic" dictionary in UTF-8 character encoding.
