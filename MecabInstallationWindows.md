Since version 0.9.2 the mecab library and dictionary files have been embedded.

_([Mac instructions](MecabInstallationMacOSX.md), [Linux instructions](MecabInstallationLinux.md))_

### Download ###

> Windows users have a simple installation process for MeCab. Only one installer file needs to be downloaded: Choose the "mecab-win32" package on the [official MeCab downloads page](http://mecab.sourceforge.net/src) and download the "mecab-0.X.X.exe" file. This single installer will install both the MeCab binaries (DLL's and command-line client) and the dictionary.

### Choice of dictionary encoding ###

> Users of the Japanese-localized version of MS Windows (i.e. your menus are in japanese and the default character encoding is Shift-JIS) can choose either of the two options (UTF-8 or Shift-JIS).

> Everybody using other versions of Windows (English, Chinese, anything) should **only use the UTF-8 dictionary**.
