This directory should contain these files:

char.bin
dicrc
matrix.bin
sys.dic
unk.dic

and possibly also 

left-id.def
pos-id.def
rewrite.def
right-id.def

The *.dic, *.bin and *.def files are being omitted from source control due to their size. 

Prior to Furigana Injector version 1.2 they should have been same as ones generated by the official Mecab package, when using the "ipadic" dictionary in UTF-8 character encoding. 

From version 1.2 these dictionary files must be trimmed to only contain the yomi (reading) field. To do this all the source ipdadic *.csv files used to make the dictionary (Adj.csv, Adverb.csv, etc.) must be trimmed to keep their first 4 and second-to-last field, then the dictionary recompiled using the mecab-dict-index tool.

E.g. in Vi perform this regex substition in all the *.csv files: 

%s/^\([^,]\+,[^,]\+,[^,]\+,[^,]\+\)\(,[^,]\+,[^,]\+,[^,]\+,[^,]\+,[^,]\+,[^,]\+,[^,]\+,\)\([^,]\+\).*$/\1,\3/

  and then recompile the *.bin and *.dic files using a command like the below (-f is the encoding of the *.csv files; -t is the encoding in the output):
  
mecab-dict-index -d <new_mecab_dics_dir> -o <new_mecab_dics_dir> -f EUC-JP -t utf8
