## Furigana Injector has been shutdown (as of Dec 31 2013) ##

Feel free to fork any code here if you'd like to make a replacement.

N.b. the [Furigana Inserter fork](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/furigana-inserter/) is still alive and well.

udonmai-san has built the furigana\*server**on MacOSX, so that he can run it all locally on his desktop/laptop.**

His github of his own version is at https://github.com/udonmai/furigana-injector/. The instructions of his changes are on the following wiki page: [Udonmai\_MacOSX\_build](Udonmai_MacOSX_build.md).

## Furigana Injector was ... ##

> the sum of these parts:

  * [MeCab](http://mecab.sourceforge.net/) natural-language parser (server or XPCOM component.)
  * Adjustable array of user's known kanji (javascript)
  * Webpage-text parsing (javascript)
  * Webpage DOM manipulation to insert `<RUBY>` tags. (javascript)
  * GUI controls and help pages (javascript, image and html resources)

If you want to contact the developer you may freely email him at **akira.kurogane** at gmail. If you want to use the server program as a localhost service you will have to compile for yourself, so **experienced C++ project builders only** thanks.
